# PCD PROCESSOR TOOL #

This tool is a developed solution for PointcloudPosition postprocessing in a fast and easy way. 

The app runs by cmd line, and it's intended to generate multiple data for studies of effectiveness of filter and generation of meshes by triangulation.

### What do you need ###

* [PCL to be installed in your computer](https://pointclouds.org/downloads/)
* A Gcc compiler and CMake for building the proyect
* Your pointcloud data in .pcd format

### How do you use the app ###

* Execute the ./pcd_processor_tool of your build folder. You can add (is optional but accelerates the workflow) directly the route to the desired .pcd pointcloud and the route to the save folder in the input of the run. Ex: ./pcd_processor_tool /home/user/my_pointcloud.pcd /home/user/savings/

* Once youre inside the app, follow the guidelines that are shown in the screen

### List of features implemented ###

* Voxelgrid with loaf size selection
* OutliersFilter with NN and deviation selection
* MLSFilter with polynomial order and size of neighborhood selection
* Triangulation with number of points and max distance selection
* Save pcd file generated with given noun
* Save stl file generated by triangulation with given noun
* (Not accesible but implemented) Normal estimation with NN selection

### FUture intended additions ###
* Would like to add PCL visualizator for quality of life improvements in handling data
* More filters and postprocessing approaches that PCL handles you
